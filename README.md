# The BingeList
This is a web application submitted for our CCAPDEV - Web Application Development class.
It's basically an app where you can create binge lists of movies.

To run it on your device, you will need to first install MongoDb and Nodejs.

In MongoDb Compass, create a database named `user-db` and add a collection named `movies`.

Import the movie database from the csv file into the `movies` collection in MongoDb Compass.

In the command prompt, go to the folder of the app, then first run `npm install`.

After this, you may run the app by executing `node index.js` and go to http://localhost:5000/login.
